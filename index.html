        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This is a small website I've made to tell the history of the protests that occurred in Beijing between April and June of 1989. This spontaneous student movement 
            swept the world with images of rebellion and supression, violent and peaceful protest, and remains a defining moment for China and the world today. 
            The day I created this website - June 4th, 2024, is the 35th anniversary of the massacre which ended the protests. I think that many people in the west 
            know that the protests happened and that they were violently destroyed, but I also think many people don't know what the protests were about, nor about 
            anything more than their violent end. This is my effort, three and a half decades later, to rectify that in the small way I can. Here you can read 
            about the problems in China that led to the protests, the protests themselves, and their bloody end.

            came to power centered around the personality of <span class="moreinfo" title="De-facto leader of Communist China roughly from 1978 to 1989">Deng Xiaoping</span>. The policies of Deng's faction involved an "opening up" of the country - inviting US presidents to visit the nation, allowing some foreign media, etc. The largest change, by far, was the re-introduction of de-facto private property into the Chinese economy. For the first time since the 1950s it was possible to open a business and own it privately, to sell private goods, and to hire and fire people without government bureaucracy. This brought rapid growth to the Chinese economy, but also of course many downsides. Private businesses easily outcompeted the old public work <em><span class="moreinfo" title='Literally "workplace" in Chinese, the Socialist system of distributing housing, healthcare, etc. based on your job'>danwei</span></em> system, leaving most Chinese workers stuck choosing between a rapidly declining public-sector job and a private sector job with significantly worse pay and benefits. Economic anxiety was worsened by inflation, which in many cities reached nearly 30% annually at its peak in the late 1980s.</p>
        <hr class="small">
        <p>One of the demographics that suffered the worst from the market reforms were urban intellectuals. While they had been a highly valued group in the past, the <span class="moreinfo" title="A period during the late 1960s and 1970s when Mao Zedong launched a mass student movement to remove 'bourgiousie elements' from Chinese culture">Cultural Revolution</span> had left many destitute, and the new market reforms meant that financial skills were valued above everything else. In April of 1988 China's senior economist, Qian Jiaju, stated in a speech that "primary school teachers in China are paid about 1 percent, and university professors about 2 percent, of what their counterparts in Hong Kong receive. No teachers, at any level, get 10% of what they were paid during World War Two [before the Communists ruled]." While theoretically the worse pay was made up by public sector benefits - housing, healthcare, etc. - most universities simply could not afford to provide these to their workers. Beijing University was budgeted at a flat rate of 45 million yuan annually for the entirety of the 1980s - not even being raised to keep up with rapid inflation. Hiring quotas imposed by the government also meant that many intellectuals - especially younger ones - were simply never given jobs equivalent to their skillsets.</p>

        <hr class="small">
        <p>Beyond economics, however, the market reforms opened up a tidal wave of corruption. Where privatization spread, there was money to be made, and those who were already in power benefitted the most. One of the most widespread forms of corruption - or what was at least perceived as widespread - was known as <em>guandao</em>, "official profiteering". This was when <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> bureaucrats would use their political connections to buy goods in bulk off of the public market, which was mandated to always have low prices. The bureaucrat would then resell those goods on the private market at a massive profit. High-ranking officials in the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> were perceived to also regularly engage in nepotism, filling the ranks of mid-level bureaucracies - and newly created private companies - with their children and other relatives. The actual extent of this corruption is hard to determine even today, but it was viewed by the Chinese people as extremely common.</p>

        <h1>The Protests Begin</h1>
        <p><span class="bigtext">One</span> of the leading figures within the Communist Party of China was a man named Hu Yaobang. Hu had been one of the more prominent bureaucrats during the reform period, and during the 1980s had been one of the most vocal anti-corruption voices from within the party. For this in 1987 he was expelled from the party due to his supposed “democratic sentiments”. On April 15th, 1989, he died of natural causes.</p>
        <figure class="center">

        </figure>
        <hr class="small">
        <p>A long tradition exists in Chinese culture of protesting by attending funerals. Hu Yaobang, having been a vocal opponent of corruption, became a centerpiece of an unexpected student protest movement. Thousands attended his memorial and continued to commemorate his death in public. Commemorating Hu was a way to maintain plausible deniability while protesting – rather than being a protest against corruption and in favor of freedom of speech, assembly, etc., it was simply public mourning for a prominent Communist who had advocated for these things. The movement was entirely spontaneous, and rapidly grew into a genuine and large student movement. </p>
        <p>By April 18th the students had created a list of 7 demands which they planned to present to the Communist Party. The demands included ending corruption, introducing more guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc. None of the demands were necessarily against the market reforms, nor against the general direction the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> was taking. The students hoped for “democracy”. This did not mean they wanted Liberal parliamentary elections, but more that they felt their voices were not being heard properly as the reforms went forward. The protests were not against the market reforms, just the way that they were being conducted.</p>

        <hr class="small">
        <p>The official funeral for Hu Yaobang was held on April 22nd, 1989. In attendance were most of the higher ups within the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span>, including <span class="moreinfo" title="De-facto leader of China from roughly 1978 to 1989">Deng Xiaoping</span> and the prime minister Li Peng. Thousands of students gathered outside the funeral, including representatives of the newly-formed student union who held their list of demands, but no audience was given. On April 26th the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC's</span> official newspaper, People’s Daily, published an editorial calling the protestors chaotic and anti-Communist. This was widely regarded as an official condemnation of the protests by the government. The fact that it took over a week for the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> to respond to the protests at all revealed that there were deep divisions within the party over how to deal with the protests.</p>

        <p>On April 27th students from every university in Beijing organized marches to Tienanmen  Square. The marches were extremely popular, gained the support of the general populace of Beijing beyond the student movement, and were almost entirely peaceful. Remarkably, the marches all succeeded in reaching Tienanmen  Square despite several police blockades around the city. An additional march was held a week later, on March 4th, 1989, which was also successful. By the end of the day the Chinese government announced they would negotiate with the leaders of the protests. A protest that had been officially condemned by the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> had forced the government’s hand.</p>

        <hr class="small">
        <p>The government, however, continually delayed and stalled on holding the talks. In hopes of forcing the government’s hand again, students began a hunger strike on May 11th. Placing additional pressure on the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> was the scheduled visit, later that week, of Mikhail Gorbachev to Tienanmen  Square, the first time a Soviet leader had visited the People’s Republic in decades. The hunger strike lasted a week before the government finally gave in and held the talks they had promised. The actual negotiations, however, quickly stalled as various student factions presented differing demands to the government. The <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> had also promised to televise the negotiations to the entire nation. After the protestors found out that the talks weren’t being broadcasted, the meeting broke down entirely.</p>
        <hr class="big">
        <h1>Crackdown</h1>
        <p><span class="bigtext">The</span> leadership of the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span>, previously divided between repressing or encouraging the protests, now swung hard in the direction of repression. Zhao Ziyang, the most prominent leader sympathetic to the protestors, left his government office and joined the protestors before disappearing into the crowd. He was later arrested, and it was his last public appearance during his life. Meanwhile, Li Peng – prime minister of China – declared martial law in Beijing on May 20th. </p>

        <hr class="small">
        <p>Fearful that the students alone would have their movement crushed, the entire population of Beijing now came out to join the protests. Workers across the city declared a new labor union, independent of <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> leadership, and organized the distribution of medicine, supplies, food, and water to the students. Tienanmen  Square became outright occupied by students and workers. On May 20th the People’s Liberation Army entered the city, but soldiers refused to open fire on unarmed citizens. Crowds surrounded army transport trucks and subjected the soldiers to continual verbal harassment. Some of the crowds applauded the soldiers for refusing to follow violent orders and gave them food and water. After a week the army withdrew from the city, which many perceived as a victory.</p>

        <hr class="small">
        <p>In fact, the army had withdrawn to reorganize, not as a concession of defeat. Soldiers were drawn in from other parts of China who would have less qualms about treating Beijing citizens violently. They were given a simple order: reach Tienanmen  square “by all means necessary”. Over the night of June 3/4th soldiers drove into Beijing using the main road that leads to Tienanmen , the Avenue of Eternal Peace (Changan avenue). Soldiers fired live ammunition into crowds of unarmed protestors. Often, even after being shot at, protestors would only retreat temporarily and then return. The sound of gunshots would attract even larger crowds, leading to more chaos and violence. Protestors threw rocks and molotov cocktails at the soldiers.</p>

        <hr class="small">
        <p>By the early hours of June 4th the People’s Liberation Army had reached Tienanmen  Square and violently suppressed the protests. Estimates of those killed and injured range from the hundreds into the low thousands. Sporadic protests and violence continued through the rest of the week, including the now famous <a href="https://youtu.be/YeFzeNAHEhU">“tank man”</a> protest, which occurred on the 5th. The movement never regained its momentum, and by the end of June the <span class="moreinfo" title='CPC stands for "Communist Party of China"'>CPC</span> was back in control over Beijing.</p>
        <p>The actual message of the protests had been vague from the beginning, as the students never really had central leadership or plan. The movement had been a sudden, unplanned outburst of anti-corruption sentiment. The people called for freedom of speech, assembly, and "democracy" not as an attempt to destroy China's entire governmental structure, but as a slogan against a government that seemed absolutely determined 
            to ignore their plight so long as it brought profits. In the end, Deng Xiaoping’s reforms continued, and China entered the 90s even more committed to economic growth – whatever the price.</p>
        <hr class="big">
        <h1>Notes & Sources</h1>
        <p>On my use of "CPC" instead of "CCP": In general, I prefer to present history as closely as possible to the way that the people living through that history viewed themselves. The Communist Party of China, in its official English communiques, calls itself that rather than the "Chinese Communist Party". This is due to a general ideological commitment to be Communists first, national citizens second, and so Communist comes before China in the party's name. Because CPC is what the Communists called themselves, it it what I will call them here.</p>
        <p>You can view a calendar timeline of the major events <a href="img/timeline.png">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Most of the information from the section on China before the protests is from the book <em>Evening Chats in Beijing: Probing China's Predicament</em> by E. Perry Link, specifically chapters one and two.</p>
        <p>Information about the course of the protests was derived from my college notes along with chapters 24 and 25 of <em>Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic</em> (third edition) by Maurice Meisner.</p>
        <p>Images were found in various places, including news sites, textbooks, and old images provided by my Chinese history professor.</p>
